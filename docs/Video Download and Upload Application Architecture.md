**Date:** July 26, 2025

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the architecture for a video download and upload application that provides a flexible, extensible storage backend system. The application is designed to download videos from various platforms and upload them to configurable cloud storage providers, starting with Supabase but architected for seamless migration to other storage solutions.

## System Overview

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns, enabling easy maintenance and extensibility. The core components include a video download engine, a storage abstraction layer, and a REST API interface.

### Key Design Principles

**Storage Provider Agnostic**: The system uses an abstract storage interface that allows switching between different cloud storage providers without modifying the core application logic.

**Modular Architecture**: Each component is designed as an independent module with well-defined interfaces, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

**Configuration-Driven**: Storage provider selection and configuration are managed through external configuration files, enabling runtime switching without code changes.

**Scalable Design**: The architecture supports horizontal scaling and can handle multiple concurrent video processing requests.

## Architecture Components

### Storage Abstraction Layer

The storage abstraction layer is the cornerstone of the application's flexibility. It defines a common interface that all storage providers must implement, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the underlying storage technology.

#### Base Storage Interface

The base storage interface defines the following core operations:

- **upload_file(file_path, destination_key)**: Uploads a local file to the storage provider
- **download_file(source_key, local_path)**: Downloads a file from storage to local filesystem
- **delete_file(file_key)**: Removes a file from storage
- **get_file_url(file_key)**: Retrieves a public or signed URL for file access
- **list_files(prefix)**: Lists files with optional prefix filtering
- **file_exists(file_key)**: Checks if a file exists in storage

#### Storage Provider Implementations

Each storage provider implements the base interface while handling provider-specific authentication, configuration, and API interactions. The initial implementation focuses on Supabase, with the architecture designed to accommodate additional providers such as:

- Google Cloud Storage
- Amazon S3
- Azure Blob Storage
- DigitalOcean Spaces
- Local filesystem (for development)

### Video Download Engine

The video download engine handles the complex task of extracting video content from various platforms. It utilizes yt-dlp, a powerful and actively maintained fork of youtube-dl that supports hundreds of video platforms.

#### Supported Platforms

The download engine supports a wide range of video platforms including but not limited to:

- YouTube
- Vimeo
- TikTok
- Instagram
- Twitter/X
- Facebook
- Twitch
- And hundreds of other platforms supported by yt-dlp

#### Download Process

The download process follows these steps:

1. **URL Validation**: Verify that the provided URL is valid and supported
2. **Metadata Extraction**: Extract video information including title, duration, format options
3. **Format Selection**: Choose optimal video format based on quality and compatibility requirements
4. **Download Execution**: Download the video to a temporary local directory
5. **Post-Processing**: Apply any necessary format conversions or optimizations
6. **Cleanup**: Remove temporary files after successful upload to storage

### API Layer

The REST API layer provides a clean interface for client applications to interact with the video processing system. It handles request validation, authentication, and orchestrates the download and upload workflow.

#### Endpoint Design

The API follows RESTful principles with the following primary endpoints:

- **POST /api/videos/process**: Initiates video download and upload process
- **GET /api/videos/{video_id}/status**: Retrieves processing status
- **GET /api/videos/{video_id}**: Retrieves video metadata and storage information
- **DELETE /api/videos/{video_id}**: Removes video from storage
- **GET /api/videos**: Lists processed videos with pagination

### Configuration Management

The configuration system enables runtime switching between storage providers and environment-specific settings. It supports multiple configuration sources including environment variables, configuration files, and runtime parameters.

#### Configuration Structure

The configuration is organized into logical sections:

- **Storage Configuration**: Provider selection and provider-specific settings
- **Download Configuration**: Video quality preferences, format options, and platform-specific settings
- **API Configuration**: Server settings, authentication, and rate limiting
- **Logging Configuration**: Log levels, output formats, and destinations

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

The implementation begins with establishing the core infrastructure including the storage abstraction layer and basic configuration management. This foundation ensures that subsequent development follows the established architectural patterns.

### Phase 2: Video Download Integration

The second phase focuses on integrating the video download capabilities using yt-dlp. This includes implementing robust error handling, progress tracking, and support for various video formats and qualities.

### Phase 3: Supabase Storage Implementation

The third phase implements the Supabase storage provider, including authentication, file upload/download operations, and URL generation for public access.

### Phase 4: API Development

The fourth phase develops the REST API endpoints that tie together the download and storage functionality, providing a complete interface for client applications.

### Phase 5: Configuration and Testing

The final phase implements comprehensive configuration management and conducts thorough testing to ensure reliability and performance.

## Storage Provider Extension Guide

Adding support for new storage providers requires implementing the base storage interface and providing appropriate configuration options. The following steps outline the process:

### Step 1: Create Provider Class

Create a new class that inherits from the base storage interface and implements all required methods. The class should handle provider-specific authentication, error handling, and API interactions.

### Step 2: Configuration Integration

Add configuration options for the new provider, including authentication credentials, endpoint URLs, and provider-specific settings.

### Step 3: Factory Registration

Register the new provider with the storage factory to enable runtime selection based on configuration.

### Step 4: Testing and Validation

Implement comprehensive tests to ensure the new provider works correctly with the existing application logic.

## Security Considerations

The application implements several security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities:

**Input Validation**: All user inputs, particularly URLs, are validated to prevent injection attacks and ensure they point to legitimate video content.

**Authentication**: Storage provider credentials are securely managed through environment variables and encrypted configuration files.

**Access Control**: The API implements appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to video processing functionality.

**Data Privacy**: Temporary files are securely deleted after processing, and storage access is controlled through provider-specific security mechanisms.

## Performance Optimization

The application is designed with performance in mind, incorporating several optimization strategies:

**Asynchronous Processing**: Video download and upload operations are handled asynchronously to prevent blocking the API interface.

**Caching**: Metadata and frequently accessed information are cached to reduce redundant operations.

**Resource Management**: Temporary storage usage is minimized through efficient cleanup processes and streaming uploads where possible.

**Concurrent Processing**: The system supports multiple concurrent video processing requests with appropriate resource limits.

## Monitoring and Logging

Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities are built into the application to facilitate troubleshooting and performance analysis:

**Structured Logging**: All operations are logged with structured data to enable efficient searching and analysis.

**Progress Tracking**: Video download and upload progress is tracked and made available through the API.

**Error Reporting**: Detailed error information is captured and reported to facilitate quick resolution of issues.

**Performance Metrics**: Key performance indicators are tracked to identify optimization opportunities.

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a solid foundation for a flexible and extensible video download and upload application. The storage abstraction layer ensures that the application can adapt to changing requirements and take advantage of different storage providers as needed. The modular design promotes maintainability and enables independent development and testing of individual components.

The implementation strategy outlined in this document provides a clear roadmap for development, ensuring that each phase builds upon the previous work while maintaining architectural integrity. The result will be a robust, scalable application that can handle diverse video processing requirements while remaining adaptable to future needs.
