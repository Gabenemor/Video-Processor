## Overview

This application provides a robust, scalable solution for downloading videos from various platforms and uploading them to configurable cloud storage backends. Built with Flask and designed with a modular architecture, it supports easy switching between storage providers while maintaining consistent functionality.

## Key Features

### Multi-Platform Video Download
The application leverages yt-dlp, a powerful and actively maintained video extraction tool, to download videos from hundreds of platforms including YouTube, Vimeo, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Twitch, and many others. The download engine automatically handles format selection, quality optimization, and metadata extraction.

### Flexible Storage Backend
The storage abstraction layer allows seamless switching between different cloud storage providers without modifying the core application logic. Currently implemented providers include Supabase, with architecture designed to easily accommodate Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, and other cloud storage solutions.

### RESTful API Interface
A comprehensive REST API provides endpoints for video processing, status monitoring, file management, and configuration access. The API follows RESTful principles and includes proper error handling, validation, and CORS support for frontend integration.

### Configuration Management
Environment-driven configuration system enables runtime switching between storage providers and environment-specific settings. Configuration can be managed through environment variables, configuration files, or a combination of both.

### Asynchronous Processing
Video download and upload operations are handled asynchronously to prevent blocking the API interface, enabling concurrent processing of multiple video requests with appropriate resource management.

## Architecture

### Storage Abstraction Layer
The foundation of the application's flexibility lies in its storage abstraction layer. This design pattern defines a common interface that all storage providers must implement, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the underlying storage technology.

The base storage interface includes essential operations such as file upload, download, deletion, URL generation, file listing, and existence checking. Each storage provider implements these operations while handling provider-specific authentication, configuration, and API interactions.

### Video Download Engine
The video download engine utilizes yt-dlp to handle the complex task of extracting video content from various platforms. The engine supports automatic format selection based on quality preferences, metadata extraction including title, description, duration, and uploader information, thumbnail downloading, and comprehensive error handling.

The download process follows a structured workflow: URL validation to ensure the provided URL is valid and supported, metadata extraction to gather video information, format selection based on quality and compatibility requirements, download execution to a temporary local directory, optional post-processing for format conversions, and cleanup of temporary files after successful upload.

### API Layer
The REST API layer provides a clean interface for client applications to interact with the video processing system. It handles request validation, authentication, and orchestrates the download and upload workflow through well-defined endpoints.

## Storage Provider Extension

The application is designed to easily accommodate new storage providers. Adding support for a new provider requires implementing the base storage interface and registering the provider with the storage factory.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create Provider Class**: Create a new class that inherits from `BaseStorage` and implements all required methods including `upload_file`, `download_file`, `delete_file`, `get_file_url`, `list_files`, and `file_exists`.

2. **Handle Provider-Specific Logic**: Implement authentication, error handling, and API interactions specific to the storage provider.

3. **Configuration Integration**: Add configuration options for the new provider in the configuration management system.

4. **Factory Registration**: Register the new provider with the `StorageFactory` to enable runtime selection.

5. **Testing and Validation**: Implement comprehensive tests to ensure the new provider works correctly with the existing application logic.

### Example Implementation

```python
class CustomStorage(BaseStorage):
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        super().__init__(config)
        # Initialize custom storage client
        self.client = CustomStorageClient(
            api_key=config['api_key'],
            endpoint=config['endpoint']
        )
    
    async def upload_file(self, file_path: str, destination_key: str, 
                         metadata: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Implement custom storage upload logic
        pass
    
    # Implement other required methods...

# Register the new provider
StorageFactory.register_provider('custom', CustomStorage)
```
